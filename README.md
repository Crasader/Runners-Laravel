### Fast developpement setup

**Make sure you have PHP in you PATH**

First, you will need to install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) if not already done.
```
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === '55d6ead61b29c7bdee5cccfb50076874187bd9f21f65d8991d46ec5cc90518f447387fb9f76ebae1fbbacf329e583e30') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```


To get a local developpement server, you can use the following command :
```
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

```
You'll need a mysql server. Modify your .env to adapt to your Mysql installation
```
DB_USERNAME=YOURUSERNAME
DB_PASSWORD=YOURUSERNAMEPASSWORD
```
Then you will either need to create, and or provide an empty database name in the .env
```
DB_DATABASE=THEDATABASENAME
```

Then execute the following command to create and populate your databse with dummy data.
```
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Then execute ```php artisan serve ```. This command will launch a PHP developpment server accessible on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Normal setup

The normal setup is if you want to work with a full stack development server. This is if you already posses either an Nginx, or Apache server, and some form of SQL server running.

This installation and configuration of these tools is beyond the scope of this installation manual.

To install Runners-Laravel , first get composer (please visit the section above for more information).

Then install the dependencies, and scaffold the app
```
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Make sure to edit the ```.env``` file, and add the correct database connection, and other variables necessary.

After that you will need to create the migrations. For this you may execute the following commands
```
php artisan migrate --seed
```

This will create the database tables **AND** populate the database with Dummy Data.
The dummy data includes a default login for the system.

If you are stuck during the installation, please visit the [laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/installation), or create an [issue](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/Runners-Laravel/issues/new).
