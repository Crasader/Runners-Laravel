## Dev env

If you use a **Windows** environment, we recommend to use the [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/homestead) preconfigured virtual machine. We explain all the install and configuration procedure for homestead in the next sections of this doc.

If you use an **Unix like** OS (Linux, macOS), we can also use Homestead, but its already possible to install the app in local, for best perfs, in this case make shure to have all the requirements installed properly and working on our machine.
