# Testing the api

## High level test

For testing the api routes and json responces, we use the popular [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) tool. It provides a clean gui for testng api's via ajax request.
You can find our insomnia test configuration in the `/tests/ApiCrudTests` folder. Just import it on insomnia, you will see the list of tested cruds.

It's also possible to use other tools, like [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) another popular client.
